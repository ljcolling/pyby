## pyby

`pyby` is a re-write of the [`{BFDA}` `R`
Package](https://github.com/nicebread/BFDA).

In the future this library will be extended into a full package, but the
current version is just intended as a demonstration of how much compute
time can be reduced through the use of better algorithms and a switch in
language.

### Background

On my blog I outlined a functional re-write of the BFDA package. In
[Part I](https://blog.colling.net.nz/posts/speeding-up-bfda-part1) and
[Part II](https://blog.colling.net.nz/posts/speeding-up-bfda-part2) I
demonstrated how adopting a more functional coding style had a duel
benefit: First, it resulted in more readable code. And Second, it made
it easier to identify computational inefficiencies.

Using these principles I re-wrote the `{BFDA}` package in `R`. This led
to a large reduction in the time needed to perform the simulations (see
table below).

| VERSION                 | RUNNING TIME              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| BFDA (original)         | 397.119s (\~6.62 minutes) |
| tidyverse-based rewrite | 95.661s (\~1.59 minutes)  |
| base R-based rewrite    | 77.866s (\~1.3 minutes)   |

This package demonstrates a re-write in Rust with an even large decrease
in compute time. For same model as outlined in the blog post
in the Python/Rust version completes the simulations
in 1.6s. The results are shown below.

```python
import pyby
import time
import pandas as pd

tic = time.perf_counter()

df = pyby.bf_sim(
    0.5,
    "t.paired",
    {"family": "Cauchy", "params": [0, 0.707], "alternative": "two.sided"},
    sampling_rule={"n_min": 50, "n_max": 300, "step_size": 5},
    alternative="two.sided",
    reps=1000,
    seed=1600,
)

df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(
    df, columns=["id", "true.ES", "n", "logBF", "emp.ES", "statistic", "p.value"]
)
toc = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Simulation performed in {toc - tic:0.4f} seconds")
print(df)
```
